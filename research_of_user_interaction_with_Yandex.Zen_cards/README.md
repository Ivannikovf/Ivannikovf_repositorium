# Research of user interaction with Yandex.Zen cards
The Yandex.Zen resource hosts cards with the theme of blog posts. Each post is created by various resources, which also have their own theme. The marketing department ordered a Dashboard that should answer the following questions:
-How many user interactions with cards occur in the system, broken down by card topics?
-How many cards do sources with different topics generate?
How do the themes of the cards and the themes of the sources relate?

Having developed a pipeline, and having agreed on the TOR, we created the following dashboard:

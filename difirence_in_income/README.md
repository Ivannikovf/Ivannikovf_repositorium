# The Difference in monthly income by gender in the company


In our study, we want to look at the income gap in a particular company by gender to improve the environment and promote equality between genders.
It is also necessary to understand how salaries are distributed depending on age, whether there is a correlation between other indicators affecting wages, and how the salary budget is distributed between different departments.
Also, we must:
• Prepare the model in Power BI using the .CSV file provided
• Make the dataset into a star schema
• Create measures using variables
• Identify outlier areas

Tools: Power BI

## Conclusions.
1. We checked the data of staff on gender equality income.
2. In our research we show, that in this company there is no significant difference between the average income of male and female workers.
3. Moreover, it is shown that in some departments, women's salaries are even higher
4. Work experience is the main factor on which salary depends.
5. A larger budget for men's salaries is since there are more men in the company in the ratio of 40% women, 60% men. HRs should pay attention to the unequal occupation of positions.

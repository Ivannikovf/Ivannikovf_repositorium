# Project name - PC Game Sales Research
## Description of the project
We have at our disposal a database of historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres, and platforms. <br/>
The objective of the project is: To reveal the patterns that determine the success of the game, which will allow you to place a bet on a potentially popular product and plan further advertising campaigns.<br/>
The main goals of the project are: <br/>
- Determine how many games were released in different years<br/>
- See how sales have changed by platform. Select platforms with the highest total sales and plot the distribution by year. <br/>
- Select the most relevant and significant data, data for the relevant current period. Define this period.<br/>
- Determine which platforms are leading in sales, growing, or falling? Select multiple potentially profitable platforms.<br/>
- See how sales within one popular platform are affected by user and critic reviews. <br/>
- Look at the overall distribution of games by genre. What can you say about the most profitable genres?<br/>
- Define for the user of each region (NA, EU, JP):<br/>
Most popular platforms (top 5).<br/>
The most popular genres (top 5).<br/>
